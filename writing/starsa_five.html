  <h1><u>Starsa- Chapter 1: Five</u></h1>
</div>
<br>
<p class="section-block">  Five was the lucky number of Xing and so they had five children.</p>

<p>The boy came first, healthy and strong- he would grow to be over one hundred <i>li</i> tall and strike an impressive stance just by holding a cigarette to his mouth as his chest exhaled slowly. But first he was a baby, just the first born of five. They could have stopped there- the heir was born- but they had a lucky number to reach.</p>

<p>Then came a stream of two girls. We need not concern ourselves with them. One became a <i>keipo</i> model, her long legs lending themselves well to be shown off in the subtle slit of every <i>keipo</i>, the form fitting dress of the wealthy women of Xing. The other, alas, did not have the looks or the legs of her older sister. She spent much of her childhood with birds. She married well.</p>

<p>Child four's birth was so painful that they almost agreed not to have any more children, almost gave up the dream of five. Child four was the second boy, the one whose older sisters would dress up in mini <i>keipos</i> and whose older brother would flick across the head. Perhaps we can blame his siblings' treatment of him as a child for how he turned out.</p>

<p>Years later, when the mother forgot about the pain of child four, child five was born. Another girl, and so the five was complete. The world watched them grow up, not even the high walls of the estate able to hide them. If we want to understand why the world watched them so, we would have to go all the way back to the Marid invasion. But for now, it will suffice to say that we can start from when their parents met- the father, the only son of the House of Shing whose hair was so dark, even until his last days, that you could not help but stand a bit straighter if you were noble enough to be in his presence, and the mother- a simple nomad whose swinging hips captured men's attention even after they had held five children for a grand total of forty five months.</p>

<p>They had met on the steps leading up to the Yerma Valley- he, ascending the stairs with his entourage of like minded political friends, and she was flitting down the steps, feet barely touching the ground. He could not help but to ask for her to stop, to ask if she could sit still for just a moment so he could take her in. Ordinarily she would have snapped for him to keep his eyes to himself, that her body did not exist just for him to look at. But as she opened her mouth she saw that his eyes were sincere, even child like, and so she halted in front of him, feet firmly on the ground. Witnesses said that all the air around them held still, and that nothing as much as a single leaf blew between them. He would invite her to watch the windbreaking from his boxed off seats right in the middle tier of the Valley and she would agree- so long as she could bring her brother whom she had just gone to fetch. They watched the windbreakers fly right in front of them, their gliders only inches away from their faces at times. Her hands itched to be flying with them; his itched to hold hers in his own.</p>

<p>The next day he told his father he had met a common girl at Yerma Valley. While he expected mild anger, instead, he received a contemplative look and a shrug that told him to move forward. So he ran through town trying to find her, the wind at his back, until he found the inn she was staying at and used all of his authority and charm to get the inn keeper to give him her room number. Even so, the inn keeper insisted on asking her first. He waited, barely breathing before the inn keeper came back with a gruff nod to the room.</p>

<p>When the door opened, a breeze picked up her curly black hair before letting it fall against her bare shoulders.</p>

<p>"My brother won't be home for a while," she said. And though her words could have implied much more, they spent the afternoon strolling through the garden, never touching until he kissed her hand goodbye.</p>

<p>On the night of their wedding, there was a typhoon. How fitting, the people murmured, already eager to see how this union would turn out. The son of stars uniting with a daughter of air- it seemed they had the world beneath them and the typhoon proved their might.</p>

<p>"How fierce, a typhoon," she thought, as he took her up the stairs.</p>

<p>"How lovely, this typhoon," he thought as she led him onto the balcony.</p>

<p>The pouring rain and raging wind greeted them as they stepped out onto the highest balcony in his estate. They waved their hands and the air around them stood still, the rain shielded off, nothing but quiet between them. The sound of their bodies embracing was like thunder in their newly created silence, their sighs gusts of wind that permeated their bodies. The rain and wind protected them from the public's prying eyes; the claps of thunder disguised their sounds as he took her on top of the world.</p>

<p>The first son they named Feng. A powerful, one syllable name meaning simply, wind.</p>

<p>The two middle daughters they named Luann and Luai- peace and love.</p>

<p>The second son they named Credence. She had objected furiously to the name but he had been set on it. A Western minister had come to visit and he had offered that the minister be given the honor of naming his second son. The minister had nodded solemnly and declared that he would be named Credence, may he always believe and serve the All Father. They had been in a tough spot when this second son was born and he needed the minister's favor.</p>

<p>"It's just a name," he dismissed, but she protested by refusing to bear him his fifth child.</p>

<p>Of course, this did not last, for he was sweet and she, for all his faults, unfortunately loved him, and so child five was born.</p>

<p>She named her Lumei and he did not object. Her name meant beauty.</p>

<p>So the wind paved way for peace, love, beauty, and... Credence. But because there was no hard 'r' sound in Xing, none of them could pronounce his name properly. They tried his full name, then a shortened name, until they just started calling him Calid. And so there were five. </p>
