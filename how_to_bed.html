  <h1><u>How to get onto a really high bed</u></h1>
</div>
<br>
<p class="section-block">  We must have read the instructions wrong because the bed ended up lofted all the way to the height of my twelve year old chest. Despite my mother’s protests, I kept it that way and my sister and I came up with tons of clever ways to get onto it. The best way was with a running start, beginning at the closet doors and sprinting then leaping and hoping for the best. The first time we tried this my sister cracked her nose against the frame of the bed. We hid under the bed, afraid somebody would find her before we could clean her up. I draped a blanket from the frame to the floor and we created a fort where we pressed tissues against her nose until they came out clean. We kept the blanket there, and on nights that seemed endlessly young we would return to our fort. Those were my favorite nights.</p>

<p class="section-block">Before all of this lofting, before I even began going to school, my bed used to be as close to the ground as possible because my parents were afraid I would tumble off while I slept. They bought a divider that attached to the side of my bed. And just in case that did not work, my grandmother slept in a temporary bed next to mine.</p>

<p>	“Let’s see… where were we…” she would say as she lay down, holding a book over her face. Her voice would be the last thing I heard and the sight of wrinkled hands turning a page, blurred by the mesh divider, the last sight I would see before I fell asleep. </p>

<p class="section-block"> There was a second way we came up with to get onto a really high bed, to be done only if there was nobody else in the room, or if you were impervious to embarrassment. You sort of bend over the bed in an L shape in an effort to get as much torso on the bed as possible, then you wiggle until the rest of your body makes it on the bed as well. This one is dangerous because it is easy to get stuck and resort to floundering. Try not to do this- you are a beautiful human being with opposable thumbs and all, capable of ascending a bed, not one who resorts to the likes of our fish friends.</p>

<p>Okay, I admit I used to be a master of floundering in bed. When I was in elementary school and had my own room, my grandmother would walk in to wake me up- she would open the shades, turn on the light, shake me a few times, but when I insisted on continuing to sleep she would begin dressing me. She’d slip my socks onto my feet and when it was time for my pants she would tap my waist a few times and I’d raise my butt up so that she could slip the pants on too while I wiggled comfortably into them. She would do this for me every day - socks, waist tap, pants, wiggle- all while I buried my head deeper into the pillow. </p>

<p>When I was dressed but still bent on sleeping, she would grab the giant stuffed animal cat that slept next to me and have it swat at me with its huge paws until I laughed and agreed to go to school.</p>

<p> My parents never told me that her mind was slipping. Maybe I knew all along, but it was not until middle school when I began to wear training bras and we would go through the usual morning routine that I really noticed. Socks, waist tap, pants, huh? I would sit up to find a bra strapping my knees together and her vacant eyes staring at my bed tousled hair.  Around that time my sister became too busy for bed jumping, and for me.</p>

<p class="section-block">The last way that we came up with to get onto a very high bed was also the most fun way. The idea was that you would start by climbing on some of the smaller furniture and then ascend bigger ones like stairs until you made it close enough and high enough to the bed. I had to stop putting things on the dresser because they would always end up on the ground as soon as we launched ourselves.</p>

<p>The most frightening night of my life was the night my entire bed shook and my alarm clock- the one thing I trusted would stay on my dresser- hit the floor with a sharp metallic ring. I opened my eyes but there was only silence, and then eventually, a small whimpering. I peered out my bedroom door and stared down at my fallen grandmother, a flight of stairs separating us. I wondered how such a small body falling could seem to shake the whole house. My mother urged me to go back to bed, already calling the hospital.</p>

<p> No matter how many ways I knew how to get onto my bed, I could not that night. I crawled into my sister’s bed instead. </p>

<p>	“Her neck was bent?” she whispered. “Was it… broken?”</p>

<p> 	“I don’t know.”  </p>

<p> We did not hug or hold each other because that was not the way we were. But our tears connected us as the pillow absorbed their steady stream. </p>

<p> I think everybody would be a bit safer if we all just stayed in bed.  </p>

<p class="section-block">Towards the end of high school, a new bed appeared in my grandmother’s room. It sat at the foot of her old one and was half the size. When we had to feed her we would press a button until the top half of the bed rose to prop her up. Then, when it was time for her to sleep, we would press another button and the bed would fall back down. She never left this bed until the night we gathered around her and my mother asked my sister to check her knees. </p>

<p> "They're cold," my sister's voice cracked.</p>

<p> My mother nodded.</p>

<p> 	“Call the hospital,” she told me, but I was frozen next to the bed.  </p>

<p> 	My sister picked up the stuffed animal cat and wrapped her arms and its furry legs around me as I cried into its shoulder. </p>

<p class="section-block">	There is one foolproof way to get on a bed. Start early, say, ten years early, and begin to forget things. The key is to go slowly so that the rest of the world still thinks there is hope for you. Then begin forgetting bigger things- how to go down stairs, how to get home, your grandchildren’s names. Maybe you had skills once- none of these will matter anymore and you will forget those too. After the mind goes the body will follow easily. You’ll forget how to dress yourself, how to read, and one day somebody will carry you onto a bed. You can stay there as long as you’d like. </p>

<p>	As for how to get off of a bed, you will never have to worry about that. You can idle your time away on the bed until the day you close your eyes and let your knees go cold. Men you have never seen before will come into your room, sneak a sheet under you, and lift you into a cold grey bag. They will carry you away from your last bed while your grandchildren tear their eyes away. They will ask whoever is left if they can cover your face and maybe somebody will pipe up and say give me one more moment with her. They will peer over at you and you’ll cry this is not who I am, don’t you remember? Don’t you remember when I would read to you, when I would dress you, when I would cook all of your favorite foods? But the looks they will give you will be of pity and even relief and you will be grateful when they zip the bag over your face and bring you to your permanent bed.</p>

<p class="section-block">	That night I cleared out everything under my bed. I pushed the crates of winter clothes to the side and pulled the sheet off my mattress. My sister helped me stuff one side of the sheet between the mattress and the frame and let it drape down to the floor. I held the bottom corner up and we both crawled under. We sat in the dark, the wall hard against our backs and the air stale.</p>

<p> "Give me a moment," my sister said, and scrambled out.</p>

<p>	She returned with the giant cat stuffed animal. We propped it against the wall and snuggled into it, wrapping one paw around each of us.</p>

<p class="section-block"> 	Even if the bed is absurdly high, even if it just screams to be jumped on, screams for you to take the challenge of trying to ascend it, I guess sometimes it is okay to ignore it all. Sometimes it is okay to take a break from the bed for a night, crawl under its skin instead, and cuddle against the slow beating of another person’s heart to remind you of your own.  </p>
