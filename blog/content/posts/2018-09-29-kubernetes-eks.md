title: An Adventure into Kubernetes with Amazon EKS
description: I have a new job! With that new job comes new technology (and also a cat! But that's another story). This article goes through my work for the past three months, standing up a Kubernetes cluster with Amazon EKS and all of the fun I had along the way. Highlights include setting up monitoring and alerting, a spot instance spark cluster, and having too much power over who can access what resources (yay RBAC!).
