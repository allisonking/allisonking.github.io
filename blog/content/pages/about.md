Hi thereâ€” thanks for stopping by!

I'm Allison, currently a software engineer at [Cortico](https://www.cortico.ai) and previously at [MIT Lincoln Laboratory](https://ll.mit.edu). On this site, you'll find my occasional blog, and also a collection of what I have done either in school or outside of work just for fun. I am an engineer by day and a writer by night and am currently interested in exploring the space between the two, as well as in investigating how technology can lend a voice to traditionally silenced communities.
