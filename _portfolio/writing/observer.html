<p class="section-block"> The day Collin picked Annabelle up from engineering camp the summer after her freshman year of high school, she dropped her duffle bag at the bottom of the stairs, removed her light jacket, and stood in front of her father with hands clasped together as if in mourning.</p>

<p> “Yes, sweetheart?” Collin asked his daughter when he finally turned his attention away from the glow of his computer. It had been a long drive to pick her up from Cambridge and he was eager to sit back down at his desk, having thought of, in the seventh hour of their road trip, the exact wording he needed to describe the functionality of pins 32 and 34 of the microcontroller. </p>

<p><i>Symmetric drive characteristics </i>, he typed and saved the document.</p>

<p>“I have an announcement,” Anna said. She had gotten darker in the two months that he had not seen her for, a realization that surprised him since she had signed up for engineering camp and not some outdoors camp. It had been a surprise to him that she even signed up for engineering camp in the first place since she had always expressed more interest in her fantasy novels than her science textbooks. The side of her cheek still bore a red line from when she had fallen asleep against the seat belt for the entire ride back. She wore black athletic shorts with a blue t-shirt that he was pretty sure had sleeves when he bought it for her but now only had frayed edges where her arms came out. Her hands were still clasped together, the way they had been when she was only ten years old and at her grandmother’s funeral, head down in respect for a woman she barely knew anything about except that she should act sad at her deathbed. </p>

<p>“I have acquired myself a boyfriend,” she said solemnly, hands wringing slightly as she peeked from her curtain of fine black hair to see her father's reaction. “And I really quite like him.” </p>

<p>Collin blinked. “Oh,” he said, one hand still on his computer's keyboard, a slow gathering of sweat forming a light adhesive between his fingers and the glossed keys. He had never been good at thinking of the right things to say on the spot, something he blamed his parents for raising him in a house that rarely spoke English and in a culture that glorified the strength of silence. His mind scurried through all of the possible questions he could ask next, all while Anna stood in front of him, thin mouth beginning to frown as he remained silent. He grasped at the easiest question. “Have you told your mother?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied, her hands unclasping and folding themselves into the pockets of her shorts. She leaned her weight to her left side and slouched a bit, suddenly much more relaxed and like the Anna he had known before he dropped her off at camp. “I told her as soon as he asked me out.” She gave a small smile.</p>

<p>“And when was that?” He made a conscious effort to sound gentle.</p>
<p>“About a month ago. I thought mom would have told you.”</p>
<p>“She's had a busy month,” Collin said, though he had no reason to believe it to be true.  “When do I get to meet him?” He only asked because it seemed like something the father on an American sitcom would ask. </p>
<p>Anna beamed.  “Not any time soon unless you want to drive to Wisconsin.”</p>
<p>He mumbled something about how Wisconsin was far and Anna shrugged, saying that she knew long distance relationships at her age typically did not work out, that she had read enough books and seen enough television to know that much, but that she had nothing to lose and so would give it a try. </p>
<p>“I'll be realistic about it,” she assured. “Lydia said her parents were long distance for ten years before her father finally made enough money to bring her mother over. These kinds of stories are inspiring, aren't they?” It was the type of statement that had somebody Collin's age tried to say, it would have come out dreamy and overly optimistic. But coming out of Anna's mouth, it became just a matter of fact.  </p>
<p>Collin nodded and suggested that she unpack her duffle bag while he prepared dinner. As he turned back to the computer, he noted that she had said nothing about her own parents' long distance relationship, nothing about how her mother had begun to work abroad three years ago, nothing about her mother's rare visits twice a year, and certainly nothing about her father's silent unease. He began to compose an email only to close his laptop after a few minutes of struggling to find the right words. He walked to the other end of the kitchen, the tiles cold against his bare feet, and scooped out one cup of rice to throw into the rice cooker.</p>

<p class="section-block">He took the same train to work every morning and always sat in the same spot at a hard cream colored plastic seat closest to the door. A rusting handrail had the initials VQ and CZ carved haphazardly into it, the letters connected inside a wobbly heart that looked like it had been carved between jolts of the train. The initials were not his or Vivienne's but they were so startlingly close that the first time Collin boarded he had lingered by that handrail for just a bit too long and so the seat became his when everybody else pooled in around him and claimed the other spots. He did not mind though. His back faced the window so nobody could peer over his shoulder at the notebook he would hold open with his left hand, pushing the bottom into his stomach to prop it up so that he could write on its steady surface.</p>

<p>The train ride into the city was thirty minutes long. The first five minutes he would spend settling into his seat, nodding at the other familiar morning commuters, thinking about taking out his notebook and pen. When he did take out the notebook, he would spend another five minutes just flipping through its pages. The first two pages were circuit diagrams of a microcontroller connecting to the interface of a Nokia LCD screen, each line perfectly straight with little room for question. And the remaining pages were words.	</p>
<p>“The engineer writes poetry,” Vivienne had mused the first time she caught him hunched over a similar notebook at their campus cafe. He had slammed the notebook shut and could still remember the way her words had danced over the skin of his neck, seeming to mock its slow reddening. Even now, whenever the train stopped and passengers filed in, he would flip back to those first two pages of the microcontroller and pretend to study it, just in case anybody on the platform peered into the window. He wondered if any of the regular commuters had noticed he was always studying the schematic of the same microcontroller and LCD screen but he knew they never did because this was what was expected of him.</p>

<p>“You have the look of an engineer. Not really of a writer,” his boss explained three years ago when he interviewed for the position of a technical writer at IBM shortly after Vivienne went abroad. The other writers were English majors, communication majors, struggling authors who needed a steady income and so had sold their souls to technology. </p>
<p>“You should have called him out,” Vivienne had said, her pixelated picture on his computer furrowed in determined anger back when they used to video chat every night in her first month abroad. “It's only because you're Asian that he assumes you're an engineer and can't imagine you doing anything else.”</p>
<p>“I am an engineer though,” he had replied wryly.    </p>
<p>“And so much more.”</p>
<p>She always knew the right thing to say, regardless of the language. Collin wondered how it was she seemed to have so much more control over the English language than he did despite the fact that he had grown up in America and she in Shanghai. He only realized after he married her that it must be nice, to come home from a long day of work and have a language that she could speak rapidly in to her parents who could in turn reply in full understanding. His talks with his own parents were brief and littered with English and Chinese messily stitched together from both ends into some semblance of communication. </p>
<p>“How was your weekend?” Jenny, a fellow technical writer, asked when Collin arrived at work. She had already settled into her chair, computer displaying a welcome message as she took a slow drink of her morning coffee.</p>
<p>“Good,” he said automatically. As he shrugged his messenger bag off outside of his cubicle, the notebook still inside with no progress made, he thought carefully about what to add to the automatic response to not seem curt or rude. “My daughter has acquired herself a boyfriend.”</p>
<p>Jenny laughed, the booming sound seeming to echo off the walls around them despite their cheap fabric lining.  She threw her pale arms behind her head of thick dark hair and grinned fondly at Collin. </p>
<p>“You have a special way of talking.”</p>
<p>“How do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Like you are an observer of the language.”</p>
<p>Because he had no response, he turned into his cubicle and began to describe the exact voltage that needed to be applied to each pin of IBM's newest microcontroller. He typed quickly and efficiently. In this way, he liked technical writing and knew he was at least adequate at it. It was vapid and dry, lacking in style that made big personalities like Jenny struggle. But Collin could flit in and out of it with little effort. As he saved and attached the document to an email, he wondered vaguely if he was polluting his daughter's language. </p>
<p>“Dinner tonight?” Jenny called from her desk. </p>
<p>“I can't. Anna's back and needs to be fed. Sorry,” he added. </p>
<p>“Right. Can't her latest acquisition feed her? I'm joking, I'm joking. Maybe next time.” </p>
<p>He looked over at the wall that their cubicles shared. It told him nothing. </p>
<p>“Sorry,” he said again and she gave a sort of grunt of acknowledgment. He was not sure if he meant either of his sorrys. He had enjoyed the nights when he and Jenny would eat in the city before he took the train back to an empty house, perhaps a bit too much. At the very least she saved him from another meal of rice and canned beans. But he had a feeling they were becoming too dependent on each other- just last week she had told him more details than he cared to know about her messy divorce and he had a vague memory of complaining to her that Vivienne never returned his messages anymore. He did not like the thought of equating Vivienne's silence with a messy divorce though, and so he found himself counting down the hours, then minutes, until he could go home and eat a pleasant meal with his daughter.</p>

<p class="section-block">When he came home from work he found waiting for him on the front porch a long thin cardboard box perched against the faded white rocking chair. Upon recognizing the logo of the little running man with a bouquet of flowers, he nearly tore the top of the box open before he caught in his periphery the address label. Printed on it was his daughter's name. He tucked the box under his arm as he groped for the keys in his breast pocket, not missing the way his heartbeat gradually slowed as he recomposed himself. There was no reason for Vivienne to send him anything- Valentine's day was too far in the past and their anniversary still too far in the future.  </p>
<p>“Dad,” Anna called from upstairs where she was without a doubt on her computer, relishing the few days left before school would start again. </p>
<p>“Mm, Anna,” he returned. He placed the box upright by the glass table in the foyer before removing his shoes and loosening his tie. “Did you cook the rice? You got a package.”</p>
<p>He heard her footsteps race down the stairs before he saw her, still in her pajama shorts and another t-shirt he was pretty sure once had sleeves. </p>
<p>“Really?” she said, eyes bright. She found the package and pried the top open with gentle hands. Collin hung his tie on the doorknob of the shoe closet and went to the kitchen to heat the leftover sea bass he had been inspired to cook over the weekend. While it microwaved, he grabbed a pan from the cupboard, set the heat on the oven to high, poured a generous amount of oil into the pan, and threw in the mound of spinach Anna had washed. As the spinach shrunk, releasing its juices into the oil, Collin could see the grains of sand that she had failed to wash out in what must have been a hurried chore. He threw in some salt then threw in some more when he remembered Anna had mentioned her mother’s spinach always had more flavor than his. He scooped the vegetable into a white plate, dotting the sides with drops of green juice and set it on the table next to the sizzling sea bass. Anna was back in the kitchen, standing on a stool she no longer needed, serving the rice. They gathered around the glossed wooden table, only the two of them with the two dishes in front of them. Collin lifted the bowl of steaming rice to his mouth and picked at a chunk of white fish with his chopsticks. They ate in a comfortable silence and the crunch of sand as they chewed the spinach filled his ears. </p>
<p>Neither spoke until the end of the meal.</p>
<p>“It was a welcome back bouquet from James,” Anna said shyly, tentatively, as she picked at the last remaining grains in her bowl.</p>
<p>“That's nice of him.” An automatic response. “Did you put it in a vase?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Did you cut the stems?”</p>
<p>“Yup. And I put in that solution that comes with it.”</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>A fierce vibration against the wooden table made them both jump.</p>
<p>“It's mom!” Anna said happily, already swiping to answer the video chat.</p>
<p>Collin stood up and took both of their empty bowls to the sink at the other end of the kitchen. As he was walking, he heard the familiar voice cry, “Annabelle!” and he walked just a little faster, hoping he would not be in the camera's frame though he could not have said why.</p>
<p>Vivienne was the only one who still called her Annabelle. She had been particular about choosing the name of their daughter and Collin had loved that, the way she had mulled over each potential name, saying each one in different inflections, considering if either of their parents would have a hard time pronouncing the name. In the end she decided that she wanted a name with double letters, just like both hers and Collin's. Her mother had named her after Vivien Leigh, one of the only western actresses whose name circulated around China at the time, then added a few more double letters to make it stand out. Collin's name, on the other hand, was just a result of his immigrant mother's unfamiliarity with the language. Collin took on the task of choosing the double letter name, treating it like how he went about writing his poetry. Each word had to be carefully examined- the connotation, the pronunciation- before he allowed himself to suggest it.</p>
<p>“Annabelle,” he had said, letting the word fall out of his mouth.</p>
<p>“Annabelle,” Vivienne had repeated. She had smiled, wrapped her arms around him and kissed him, her growing stomach pressed against him, the lingering of the name on her lips the greatest poetry he had ever managed.</p>
<p>Anna turned her phone to face him. He managed a salute with a soap covered hand but could not hear what the phone said to him over the sound of the running water. He could just barely make out the shadowy outline of a woman.</p>
<p>“Why haven't you replied to my emails?” Collin called from the sink in a way he hoped sounded only curious and not accusatory. He heard Anna repeat his question, then, a static, unintelligible response.</p>
<p>“She's in Beijing this month. It's not like Taiwan- no Google there, remember? You can't email her Gmail account,” Anna reminded.</p>
<p>“Right. Of course.”</p>
<p>Anna turned the phone back to herself and brought it to the dining room to show her mother the flowers. Collin cleared the table, threw the leftovers in tupperware, and washed the plates they had used. When he turned off the water, he saw a small splotch of green on his wedding ring, a bit of spinach clinging on to the silver. He threw it back into the sink.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night, he woke up from some sort of sound. Ever since Vivienne left, he had trained himself to sleep lightly. The first time she had called at 4AM in desperate need of somebody to talk to about a complicated merger at work, he had slept right through the trill ring of his cell phone on the nightstand. Since that night, he had developed the ability to wake up even from the short buzz of a text of Vivienne reminding him to schedule an eye doctor appointment as she took a coffee break on a muggy Taiwanese afternoon. </p>
<p>His phone's screen displayed nothing though. He tapped at it and its light told him it was nearly 3 A.M. Just as he had resigned himself to go back to sleep, he heard the sound of Anna's laughter from down the hall. He limped out of bed and to her room.</p>
<p>“Oh, hold on,” he heard her say softly after his knock. “Yeah?” she called.  </p>
<p>He opened the door and squinted against the yellow incandescent light that illuminated the pink carpeted room. Anna sat on her bed facing the door, laptop propped on her knees, twirling one end of her earphones around a finger. The Hello Kitty decal on her laptop waved happily at him. </p>
<p>“You should go to bed,” he said, eyes struggling against the light.</p>
<p>“Yup, I will soon.” She turned her laptop around and he saw a video of somebody waving at him. “James says hi.” </p>
<p>“Hello James. Shouldn't you be going to bed as well?”</p>
<p>Anna rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>“It's only 2 in Wisconsin.”</p>
<p>“Bed, Anna,” he said gently but the tiredness colored his words impatient. </p>
<p>Her mouth tightened to a thin line yet she obeyed and he waited for her to say her goodbyes before leaving the room and turning the light off behind him. He took a few steps down the hallway, then paused. After a few minutes of standing in the dark, he made his way silently back to her room and burst the door open.</p>
<p>“I knew it.”</p>
<p>He found her curled up in her bed, the dim glow of her e-reader illuminating her captivated face. </p>
<p>“How did you know?” she asked, sitting upright, the blanket sliding off her torso. </p>
<p>He turned on the light. “Because you are too much like me.” Making his way to her bed, he tapped against her knees and she moved them so he could sit beside her. </p>
<p>“Back in my day...” he began. He lowered his voice into an exaggerated croak. “Back in my day we had to use a flashlight and read under the blankets! They make it too easy nowadays.” He nodded at the backlit screen she had tried to hide under her pillow. </p>
<p>She smiled in spite of herself. “I wanted to finish the book tonight.”</p>
<p>“Can't it wait for the morning? You're going to get jet lag when you try to get back onto school schedule.” It was the wrong phrase, but it was the middle of the night and he was talking to his daughter so he did not try to correct himself.</p>
<p>“I guess. But James already finished it and I wanted something to talk to him about in the morning.”</p>
<p>“Do you guys read the same books?”</p>
<p>“Yeah!” She forgot her annoyance. “I figure if we can't go on real adventures with each other in the physical world, we might as well experience the same things in our heads, you know?” </p>
<p>He could not help but smile.</p>
<p>“We decided we would take turns choosing books for both of us to read. So it'll be my turn after this one.” Her excitement was obvious and when she realized it she toned down her voice a bit. “I mean, it's just a nice way to keep in touch. Through stories.”</p>
<p>He nodded slowly. “But where are you getting these books?” He had just paid his credit card bill and had not seen any charges for e-books on there.</p>
<p>She shrugged. “I download them.”</p>
<p>He raised an eyebrow. “How?”</p>
<p>“On the internet.”</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>“By clicking on some buttons.”</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>She sighed. “Illegally.” </p>
<p>“And how does that affect the authors?”</p>
<p>“It robs them of a few cents, I guess.”</p>
<p>“And what if everybody did this?”</p>
<p>“It robs them of a lot of cents,” she replied in a slow bored manner.</p>
<p>“Now in a full sentence?”	</p>
<p>“I illegally download books to the detriment of hard working authors.”</p>
<p>“Well I'm glad you will admit it at least.” He stood up and leaned in to kiss her forehead. “Have fun reading.” He walked back to the door and turned off the light. </p>
<p>“Dad?” Her voice sounded small in the dark, her body only a lump under the blankets.</p>
<p>“Mm?”</p>
<p>“Remember when you and mom used to read stories to me at night before bed? And sometimes your poems, too?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“Maybe you should read mom a story the next time you call her.”</p>
<p>The doorknob felt cold under his hand.</p>
<p>“Maybe. Good night, Anna.”</p>
<p>“Good night.” </p>

<p class="section-block">The next day as he took the train into work, he actually managed one new verse. It was not astounding by any means, but the notebook felt solid under his pen when he wrote. Perhaps he could have written more if he did not keep flipping back to the proper engineering looking pages at the front. Or if he had not been distracted by a lady wearing a blouse covered in patterns of pink flowers which reminded him of the flowers in his own house, standing bright and young. He thought about what it would take to send flowers to Vivienne. There was always a flower vendor at the train station. He could buy a bouquet, ask for tips on how to package it, pay a bit extra for two day shipping to Taiwan. No, he thought, then she would only open a box of half wilted damaged flowers. The right way would be to find a florist in Taiwan who could deliver fresh flowers that same day. That would involve long distance calling though, having to call during the right time, and, most hindering of all, conversing in Chinese. </p>
<p>When Anna was still a toddler there had been a year where Vivienne's parents came to stay with them to spend time with their granddaughter. Collin and Vivienne had been purposeful about speaking only Chinese in the house before then in the hope that Anna would learn English through school and therefore be fluent in both languages. He hated talking in Chinese to elders who always seemed to slow down their speech for him. But with Anna and Vivienne, he could talk endlessly.</p>
<p>“I don't think Collin's American accent is good for Annabelle's Chinese,” he overheard his father-in-law tell Vivienne once. His wife had come to his defense and he never heard her parents bring up the subject again. Days later when he read to Anna, Vivienne casually corrected one of his tones. He found himself speaking Chinese less and less. </p>
<p>While the train was above ground and he still had service on his phone, he began to look up words and phrases for how to order flowers for delivery. By the time he got off the train he had written a short script, practiced it once under his breath, the words bulky and clumsy. As he began his walk to the office, he held the phone to his ear with the script in front of him, scrawled into his notebook where the next verse of his poem should have been. </p>
<p>The phone only rang once before he hung up. He remembered with a dull ache that she was in Beijing now, not Taiwan, and not only did he not know an email address that could get through the firewall to her, he also did not know her real physical address. He pocketed the phone.  </p>
<p>He did not look at it again until it was three P.M. and he received a text from Anna asking if she could eat dinner at her friend Lydia's house. He replied with a yes, sure, and when she asked if he would like her to cook some rice for him before she left, he flipped his phone over a few times in his hand.</p>
<p>“Jenny,” he called over their cubicle wall. He heard the sound of her chair's wheels rolling over the carpeted floor. Her head poked into the entrance of his cubicle. “Are you busy tonight?” </p>

<p>The restaurant Jenny had chosen was in the older part of the city where the buildings were smaller and more cramped. Collin could feel his chair move every time the man behind him laughed. Both he and Jenny had their bodies pressed as close to the table as possible just to be able to hear each other.</p>
<p>“Do you know what everybody in the office wants to know about you?” Jenny asked. Her finger took slow laps around the rim of her wine glass. She had a strange way of dressing ever since her divorce, her outfits seldom matching and most of the time an odd mixture of a formal skirt and a very casual t-shirt. He found her outfit that day- purple dress pants with a simple white shirt- endearing. </p>
<p>“What?” </p>
<p>“What your first language is.” Before he could interject that it was obviously English, that he had been born and raised in America so there could be no other option, she held up a hand. “Engineering, or poetry?”</p>
<p>He sank into his seat only to bump heads with the man behind him. “Sorry,” he muttered and scooted even closer to the table. </p>
<p>Jenny continued. “You chose a weird in between by becoming a technical writer.”	</p>
<p>“I liked technology. And I liked writing,” he said. </p>
<p>“You could have been an illustrious engineer though,” she teased. They both leaned back what little they could as the waiter squeezed by and took their finished plates away. She leaned back in to him. Her eyeshadow made her grey irises pop against her round face. He found the way a strand of her wavy brown hair dangled over her glass ridiculously tantalizing. “You had the degree and everything.”</p>
<p>“It makes more sense for companies to hire college graduates. Not old timers like me.” </p>
<p>She tucked the loose strand behind her ear and took a sip of the wine. “Do you still write?”</p>
<p>He thought about the rather pathetic verse he had written that morning and shook his head. He had not truly written since Vivienne left. Perhaps not even since those first few years of Anna's life when he would stay home with her while his wife went to work. He had only fond memories of those days, writing during Anna's naps with steadily flowing words, having dinner ready for them all when Vivienne returned, both of them putting Anna to sleep early in the evening before making slow and easy love and retiring for the night. He had written the only anthology he went on to publish during that time period.</p>
<p>“You should,” she suggested. “It's easy to get stuck in the funk of technical writing.”</p>
<p>“Do you know the story of the Monkey King?” he asked suddenly. He had asked Vivienne the same question the first time they met and she had replied with an of course and a sly smile, saying that anybody who grew up in China knew the story of the Monkey King. Jenny shook her head but listened earnestly, eyes searching him. </p>
<p>“It's about a monkey who was born from a magical stone from heaven. He had all sorts of powers like superhuman strength, cloning himself, sly talking, things like that. He got conceited though and challenged heaven. The details aren't important, but he loses and as punishment has to go on a pilgrimage with a monk and protect him. Heaven gave the monk a headband that the Monkey King had to wear forever which would cause him excruciating pain if he disobeyed the monk.” Collin paused. “I'm trying to write about that.”</p>
<p>“That's a lot to write about,” she smiled, arching an eyebrow.</p>
<p>He shrugged. “I wanted to try an epic poem. Like the Odyssey, but Asian. Only I would change one thing about the Monkey King's story.”</p>
<p>“Tell me.” They were leaning closer than they needed to be. </p>
<p>“The headband wouldn't inflict pain. It would make him unable to speak or communicate. It would silence him. I think he'd swallow his hubris a lot faster then. And the more he couldn't speak the more he wouldn't have the confidence to do his transformations or his cloning and the more he would become a regular monkey. Sub-human. And then... Well, I'm not sure after that.” </p>
<p>Before she could reply the waiter scurried past their table and placed the check on it, apologizing that they needed the table for their next guests. Collin threw his credit card on the check while Jenny dug through her purse.</p>
<p>“Shit,” she muttered. “I forgot my wallet. I took it out at work for lunch and-”</p>
<p>“Don't worry about it. I'll get this one.”</p>
<p>“Damn. Sorry, Collin. I'll pay you back tomorrow.” She really did look sorry, and for a moment he saw his own uncertainty reflected in her expression.</p>
<p>He told her again not to worry about it. He wanted to hear her curse more. It was one of his weird interests since he had been raised in a house that did not curse in any language and so he found it fascinating that these sorts of words were naturally drawn upon in heights of emotion. Vivienne could curse splendidly. He went to a talk in college once where the speaker argued that people who cursed more tended to be more honest. Did that mean he was duplicitous? </p>
<p>“Well, thanks for dinner then,” she said when they exited the restaurant and the warm air hugged them. They stretched, glad to be free of the cramped quarters. “Thanks for telling me your story.” She turned towards him and gave a sort of sad smile. “I want to know more.”</p>
<p>“Thanks for listening.” He took her hand and squeezed slightly, hoping to convey whatever it was he was feeling that could not be put into words. When she squeezed back, he put a hand to her cheek, his fingers brushing the bone and his thumb tracing her jaw. He smiled, heart beating fast, and his smile only became wider when he saw hers, mouth slightly open. He leaned closer. Her hand slid up his arm so that both of their hands touched her cheek. Then she grazed the small strip of metal still around his finger. He felt her face shift expressions under his hand and when he blinked both of their hands were back by their sides.</p>
<p>“I'm sorry,” Collin said automatically. The sounds of the city night suddenly seemed loud and booming, the humid air enveloping. 	</p>
<p>“No. No, it’s fine…” But it did not seem like she had much else to say as she turned to hide her face behind her thick hair. 	</p>
<p>He thought of Anna and suddenly felt a flood of disgust.</p>
<p>They walked for a block together before saying goodbye. Collin ran down the steps to the train and just barely caught it as he sank into one of the hard seats. He took the notebook out of his bag out of habit but none of the words seemed right.</p>
<p>He called his wife.</p>
<p>He knew what he would say. He would open by talking about Anna, one thing they undeniably had in common. About how she had enjoyed engineering camp and about her boyfriend, and why hadn't Vivienne told him about this new development? And then he would get angry and ask why she could not come back more often, why she had to be so ambitious and give up her family for a higher paying job halfway across the world. He would curse too and it would be glorious because then she would know he was being honest. She picked up on the second ring and her just made up face appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>“Hello, love.” </p>
<p>And with only two words he lost his own again. She was leaning back in her chair comfortably, legs crossed, one hand resting on the back of the chair, fingers dangling next to her neck. Her blouse seemed to drape into the chair, the pink fabric merging with the chair's red- she always had a way of seeming to fit in perfectly with her environment no matter where she was. Her hair was tied into a distracted bun that failed to hold back the finer strands from her face. All of this he remembered and observed because he could not think of how to reply. </p>
<p>“When are you coming back?” he asked. The only other occupant in the same section of the train gave him an annoyed look but he did not care.</p>
<p>The angle on the screen shifted and instead he was seeing Vivienne from the bottom right. Her head was turned to a computer and she must have leaned her phone against the monitor so that she could free her hands but still talk to him. </p>
<p>“I'm thinking before Christmas.” She pushed her glasses up. “It's not a one way street though.” She turned her head to face the camera. “You and Annabelle should come. I'll be back in Taiwan by then and it'll be a seventy degree winter.” </p>
<p>“Yeah, maybe.”</p>
<p>“Have you still been writing?”</p>
<p>“Why?” He did not expect to be asked the same question twice in one night.</p>
<p>She shrugged. “I was thinking about one of your poems this morning. There was an advertisement for the new remake of the Monkey King in my mail this morning. It looks ridiculous.”</p>
<p>“I'm glad the venerable Monkey King makes you think of me,” Collin almost smiled. </p>
<p>“Only the best for you. Oh, hold on a minute.” She spun in her chair so that he could only see her profile and hear a man's voice speak in rapid Chinese. She replied equally fluently and threw in a laugh at the end before turning back to Collin. “Come visit me.” Her eyes looked down at the screen, searching the image of his face. She spoke sincerely. “I miss both of you terribly.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Yeah, I'll talk to Anna about it.”</p>
<p>She made a face he knew well: a sort of suspicious squint. “I know you won't,” she said quietly.</p>
<p>“It just makes more sense for you to come back,” he defended. She shook her head but refocused her gaze on the monitor. It all came back to that first conversation they had when she told him she was considering a promotion that would relocate her. He had sat in silence while she listed the benefits, the salary increase, how she could be closer to her parents, how he and Anna could go with her and they could take out some loans to send her to the international school. </p>
<p>“And what would I do?” he had asked.</p>
<p>“Continue writing,” she said simply. “It won't be that different. You normally stay in the house all day anyway. Why not a house in Taiwan?”</p>
<p>“It's completely different. The language-”</p>
<p>“The language is always the problem, isn't it?”</p>
<p>The train stopped but nobody boarded. The other rider disembarked with a glare at Collin. He was alone.</p>
<p>The sound of her keyboard and mouse scrolling bounced off the train’s walls.</p>
<p>“Anna said I should tell you a story.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Go on, then.”</p>
<p>He told her the first story he could think of. In his first poem about the Monkey King, he had not changed much of the original story, only experimented with the order of the words to make the Monkey King's challenge of heaven more of a praise poem with snide undertones than the typical hubris tragedy. He told his wife about his revamped imagining of the backstory, his idea for the silencing headband, and she seemed to nod along though it was hard to tell because his service was getting weaker and her face more pixelated, her movements more choppy. He invented wildly, creating extravagant plot lines, designing intricate backstories, improvising romances until his mouth went parch and his heart pounded furiously from the excitement.</p>
<p>“What do you think?” he breathed.</p>
<p>“I think-”</p>
<p>Her face froze. A <i>Call Failed</i> screen replaced it as the train plunged into the darkness of a tunnel. </p>
<p>“Fuck.”</p>
<p>He buried his head in his hands and closed his eyes, catching glimpses of light through his eyelids whenever they passed light posts in the tunnel. The wind whipped around the train deafeningly. </p>
<p>The words never came naturally anymore. He could explain electronics, write a bit of poetry, but he did not know how to tell his wife to stay. He tapped his hand maddeningly against his messenger bag, the hard cover of his nearly blank notebook bouncing it back. </p>
<p>When the train exited the tunnel, his phone vibrated. He snatched at it hopefully.</p>
<p>He blinked at Jenny's name on the screen.</p>
<p><i>“What happens next?”</i></p>
<p>He watched the cursor in the text box blink steadily against the white background. Then, he sat up straight, brought the phone to his chest, and began to write. </p>
