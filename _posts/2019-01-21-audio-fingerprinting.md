title: Oops I did it Again-- Adapting a Pop Music Identifier to Find Syndicated Content in Talk Radio
---
Back in November of 2018, I gave a talk at [DataEngConf](https://www.datacouncil.ai) (which has since rebranded to DataCouncil) in New York City. I had a ton of fun preparing for and giving the talk on some of the work going on at Cortico, trying to detect duplicate content in American talk radio. I'll have a blog post up on how we went about detecting duplicate content (featuring Python, Spark, and Kubernetes), but for now, here's a link to the talk and the slides!
