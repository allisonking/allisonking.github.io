							<h2>An Engineer-Writer</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							Hi there&mdash; thanks for stopping by!
						</p>
						<p>
							I'm Allison, currently working on all sorts of software research at <a href="https://ll.mit.edu">MIT Lincoln Laboratory</a>. I can't go into too much detail about what I do there due to the nature of the work, so this site serves as a collection of what I have done either in school or outside of work just for fun. I am an engineer by day and a writer by night and so this site also has some of my writing. I am currently interested in exploring the space between the two disciplines and in investigating how technology can lend a voice to traditionally silenced communities.
						</p>

						<div id="more-info" class="initiallyHidden">
							<p>Oh, thanks for the interest! I guess I'll tell you a bit more about me then.</p>

							<p>I graduated from Swarthmore College in 2015 with a B.S. in Engineering. I was a reluctant Engineering major, frequently feeling like I should really have been an English major, yet unwilling to leave the glamorous problem solving life behind. Some of these thoughts I express through my short story <a href="#observer-of-languages" class="page-scroll"> <i>An Observer of Languages</i></a>. In my final semester at Swarthmore, I finally struck a balance&mdash; as my senior design project, I designed and prototyped a <a href="#ereader" class="page-scroll">Low Cost E-Reader</a>. This project combined my passion for building things, for reading and storytelling, and for accessibility across communities. The idea was that there are a ton of books in the public domain, particularly the classics, and so all that is needed is a means to read them. </p>

							<p>After Swarthmore, I immediately went to work for MIT Lincoln Laboratory. I still felt like I was in a strange state of in-between, engineering by day and writing by night. I've been able to conduct some really meaningful research at the lab, mostly on open architectures and how to verify and validate their functionality. Once again, can't go into too much detail about these projects, but here are two public facing articles of LL initiatives I've been really happy to have spent my extra time doing: <a target="_blank" href="https://ll.mit.edu/news/LegoWorkshop.html"> mentoring an all girls LEGO robot team</a>, and competing in a <a target="_blank" href="https://ll.mit.edu/news/fake-news-hackathon.html"> fake media hackathon</a>. </p>

							<p>
								One of my favorite classes in school had been <i>Asian American Literature</i>. I've continued to read books by Asian American writers since then (check out my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/20891766-allison-king?shelf=asian-american"> Asian American shelf on Goodreads!) </a>). From there, I began to read books almost exclusively by people of color, often choosing books from <a target="_blank" href="https://bookriot.com/2016/04/28/around-world-80-books-global-reading-list/"> this list </a> of books from around the world. This process inspired me to dabble in machine learning, creating an <a href="#movie-recommender" class="page-scroll">international movie recommender</a>. Besides just inspiring a fun coding project, reading these stories and connecting to them in ways I seldom had with mainstream books before made me wonder&mdash; where were these voices before? And what can I do to amplify these voices?
							</p>

							<p>
								This line of thinking inspired my next two projects. I began to collaborate with a team of all star Taiwanese Americans (one of whom was the author of one of the books I had just read&mdash; cue star struckness!) to build <a href="#our-ta-story" class="page-scroll"> Our Taiwanese American Story </a>, a story sharing site with the goal of serving as an archive for stories about the Taiwanese American experience, particularly to remember Taiwan's time in martial law and the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Terror_(Taiwan)">White Terror. </a>
							</p>

							<p>
								The other project that also came out of a desire to amplify marginalized voices was on visualizing fan fiction. I grew up reading a lot of Harry Potter fan fiction, mostly to read stories about characters JK Rowling didn't get a chance to get to, characters who were very much not a main character. It followed then that in the fan fiction community there were more stories about female characters, about gay characters, about people of color than in the canon. I decided to teach myself how to make interactive web visualizations and ended up with an essay: <a href="#fanfic-analysis" class="page-scroll">Visualizing Harry Potter Fan Fiction: 1999-2017</a>.
							</p>

							<p>
								So that's me so far! The past few years out of college have been full of teaching myself new technologies and applying them in ways to amplify the power of storytelling. My other hobbies include biking to work, buying cheap plane tickets, and watching Chinese singing competitions.
