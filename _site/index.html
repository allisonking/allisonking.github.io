                Oops I did it Again-- Adapting a Pop Music Identifier to Find Syndicated Content in Talk Radio</a>

            </h3><p>Back in November of 2018, I gave a talk at <a href="https://www.datacouncil.ai">DataEngConf</a> (which has since rebranded to DataCouncil) in New York City. I had a ton of fun preparing for and giving the talk on some of the work going on at Cortico, trying to detect duplicate content in American talk radio. I’ll have a blog post up on how we went about detecting duplicate content (featuring Python, Spark, and Kubernetes), but for now, here’s a link to the talk and the slides!</p>

            </h3>I have a new job! With that new job comes new technology (and also a cat! But that's another story). This article goes through my work for the past three months, standing up a Kubernetes cluster with Amazon EKS and all of the fun I had along the way. Highlights include setting up monitoring and alerting, a spot instance spark cluster, and having too much power over who can access what resources (yay RBAC!).</div>

                Real time visualizations with D3</a>

            </h3><p>A while back, I did <a href='http://allisonking.github.io/fanfic-analysis'>some visualizations</a> on Harry Potter fan fiction, scraped from <a href='https://www.fanfiction.net'>FanFiction.net</a>. To do this, I built a web scraper in Python, saved off the data as one huge CSV file, and had my visualizations pull from bits and pieces of this data file.</p>
<p>While this worked well for the data that I had, I found myself wishing that the data could be updated and that I could see in real time when fan fictions were being published. Even though it has been years since a Harry Potter book came out, in my scraping adventures, I found that people were still publishing their writing every hour or so! With the method I used, all of my data stopped on the day I happened to scrape it. How would I go about being able to continuously show updated data?</p></div>

            </h3><p><b>Update (1/24/2018):</b> This is now deployed on <a href='https://wikigraphs.herokuapp.com/'> Heroku!</a></p>
<p>For the past few weeks, I have been working on a project that I am currently calling Wikigraphs. What in the world is that, you ask? Well, thanks for asking! If I had to summarize it, I'd say it is a framework that allows for community driven data as input into data driven graphs, thereby allowing for transparent data sources.</p>
<p>Let's break that down.</p> </div>

                Reviewing Books of 2017</a>

            </h3><p>Wow, another year of reading has gone by! In 2016, I tried to read books exclusively by people of color (with the exception of <em>Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em>, a welcome recommendation from a co-worker). This wasn’t out of a hatred for white authors, of course, but rather a deliberate attempt to diversify my reading and therefore my experiences. And what a year it was of truly amazing books! In 2017 white authors crept back into my lineup– 5, to be exact, of which Ursula K Le Guin and Margaret Atwood lead the pack in terms of the books I enjoyed. There’s likely bias going on, but of the books I read this year, I really felt the PoC authors wrote books that stuck with me more. And how could they not with hard hitters like Viet Thanh Nguyen, Marjane Satrapi, and even Aziz Ansari? See the bottom of this post for all of the books I read last year.</p>
